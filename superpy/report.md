Prefix
For Winc Academy I have been programming an assignment named SuperPy.
As the last requirement of this program assignment states:
“
Please include a short, 300-word report that highlights three technical elements of your implementation that you find notable, explain what problem they solve and why you chose to implement it in this way. Include this in your repository as a report.md file.
•	You may use Markdown for your report, but it is not required.
•	To assist your explanation you may use code snippets.
“
This document has been made to fulfill that part of the SuperPy assignment.


chapter 1, 
Initially,

Even though I have learned my first PC steps on DOS in the nineties, I decided to make a slightly more user friendly interface than command lines for the program straight away. with the logic structure in place a command-line interface can be added later without too much trouble.
At first I thought the program should not just be able to set its date but also its time. However, since this ability would create needless complications (especially with over 24 hours offset and the interaction with setting the date) I decided to go forward without the ability to set the program's time. Most code that supported changing the time has been removed, but a few bits and pieces remain as you will no doubt see at some point.


chapter 2,
in the course of,
There were no problems which I found really hard or could not solve by using my 'favourite' search engine. The biggest troubles I have had with this assignment were starting it and the amount of work I would have to put into it.
One of the things I found most difficult was testing with pytest. I started with testing the file_manipulator.py at the start, this did not seem to be hard. But when I started with input() I kind of left the pytest behind and started testing 'oldschool' with print() and breakpoint() statements.  


Appendix
timeline:
29-08-2022 approximately 6 hours. 08:00 to 14:00
A file structure has been made as well as the code for file manipulation. a start has been made with the interface, and the date manipulation code. 
30-08-2022 approximatly 5 hours. 08:00 to 13:00
The interface and date manipulation are mostly finished today. file manipulation file has been expanded on.
