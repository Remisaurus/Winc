Write a Python program that reads text from stdin,
 filters a given character from it and writes the result to stdout.
 The number of characters removed should be written to stderr. For example:

$ echo 'abc' | python main.py a
bc
1

$ echo 'aabccc' | python main.py c
aab
3

$
You may not use the argparse module to parse the arguments to your program this time.
You can find a list of the arguments in sys.argv, 
and you may assume that the argument is always a single character.

Tip

If it is not redirected in some way, 
stderr is printed to your terminal right along side of stdout. 
While you're working on debugging your program you can add some text that tells you which stream you're looking at. 
We will later discuss how to redirect I/O streams.

When you start the assignment with Wincpy, you should see a file named random.txt inside the stds directory. 
You can read this file with cat and feed it to the stdin of your program by using the pipe symbol (|):

# This shows the first line of random.txt with all occurences of `a` removed
$ cat random.txt | python main.py a | head -n 1
0000000 8294 e3 d6b3 4167 0ef b1c8 952 e78
You can use pytest to test your implementation with the tests supplied in test_main.py.
